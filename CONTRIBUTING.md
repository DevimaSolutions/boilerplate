# Contributing

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

<hr/>

Initiate the project so it will be ready to start:

```sh
yarn setup
```

The command above executes the following tasks:

- `yarn setup:husky` - Initializes [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) hooks
- `yarn setup:env` - Create `.env` files for the `frontend` and `backend` apps
- `yarn docker:local` - Run local docker containers with PostgreSQL database and [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) service. **So make sure the docker is running when executing the setup command**

<hr/>

To start the app in dev mode use:

```sh
yarn dev
```

The frontend app will be available by default at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and backend app at [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api).

API docs can be found at [http://localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs)

<hr/>

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```sh
yarn test
```

### Database migrations

In dev mode migrations are automatically applied on a server startup.

To manually execute any migration-related commands you need to navigate to the backend app first.

```sh
cd apps/backend
```

To automatically generate new migration from changes you've made to the entities run the following command:

```sh
yarn migration:generate src/migrations/{migration-name}
```

For example it can look like this:

```sh
yarn migration:generate src/migrations/added-projects-table
```

To apply pending migrations manually run:

```sh
yarn migration:run
```

### API client package

There is an `api-client` package in a project. It's source code is generated form the backend swagger specification
using [swagger-typescript-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-typescript-api) package.

It should be used to preform any API calls to the server.

When server API specification is changed (new endpoints added, DTOs are updated, etc) you need to execute a command that will generate an updated API client:

```sh
yarn gen:api-client
```

This approach ensures the integrity of the contracts between the frontend and the backend apps during the project development.

### Development tools

This boilerplate is designed to be used within the VSCode IDE. Therefore it contains [a set of configs](./.vscode/settings.json) and a set of recommended extensions to be installed.

The list of recommended extensions is as follows:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

### Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
- `test`: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.
- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting and tests

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when committing.

### Scripts

The `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:

- `yarn setup`: installs [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) hooks
- `yarn lint`: lint files with ESLint.
- `yarn test`: run unit tests with Jest.
- `yarn dev`: start the example app.
- `yarn build`: create a production build from src
- `yarn gen:api-client`: re-generate `api-client` package based on swagger specs generated by the `backend` app.
- `yarn docker:local`: run docker containers for local development (PostgreSQL and Mailhog).

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Make sure PR passes attached Github workflows without any errors.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first directly or by opening an issue.

### Releasing

Application is deployed automatically using Github workflows once changes are merged to the `main` branch (for production) or `staging` branch (for the staging environment).
